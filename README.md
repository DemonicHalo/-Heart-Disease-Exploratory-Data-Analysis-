Heart Disease Prediction Project
Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using machine learning models. The dataset includes various attributes such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc., to predict whether a patient is at risk of having heart disease.

Project Description
The goal of this project is to:

Analyze the dataset using various exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.

Clean the data by handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.

Build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease.

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project contains information about patients, including:

Age: Age of the patient.

Sex: Gender of the patient.

Blood Pressure: Patient's blood pressure levels.

Cholesterol Levels: Cholesterol levels in the patientâ€™s blood.

Max Heart Rate: Maximum heart rate achieved during exercise.

Oldpeak: Depression induced by exercise relative to rest.

Exercise Induced Angina: Whether the patient has angina (chest pain) due to exercise.

The target variable is Heart Disease: 0 (no disease) or 1 (disease).

Installation
To run the project locally, you need to have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can set up the environment by running:

bash
Copy
Edit

# Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git
cd heart-disease-prediction

# Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
After setting up the environment, you can run the code to analyze the data and make predictions. The main script is heart_disease_analysis.py. To run the analysis:

bash
Copy
Edit
python heart_disease_analysis.py
This will load the data, perform preprocessing, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling, encoding categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical analysis to understand the data.

Predictive Model: Build a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) to predict heart disease.

Evaluation Metrics: Assess the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
